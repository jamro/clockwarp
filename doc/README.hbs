# ClockWrap

ClockWarp is an alternative to the built-in `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functions. 
This library provides time manipulation capabilities that allow you to adjust the 
timing of events in your code. ClockWarp has a time multiplier which can be used 
to make all events run faster or slower, and it also has a fastForward method that 
can be used to move time forward. 

# Example

```js
const clock = new ClockWrap()

clock.setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello World"), 5000);
clock.setTimeout(() => console.log("This is another message"), 5500);

clock.fastForward(5000)
// console output: Hello World

// wait another 500ms
await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 500));
// console output: This is another message
```
